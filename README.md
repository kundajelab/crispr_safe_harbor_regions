# crispr_safe_targeting_regions
Repository for creating the CRISPR controls termed "safe targeting" regions from Morgens et al., 2017, Nat Comms.

The files containing the safe targeting regions can be found in the table "Supplementary Data 5" from the paper [Morgens, David W., et al. "Genome-scale measurement of off-target activity using Cas9 toxicity in high-throughput screens." Nature communications 8 (2017): 15178.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15178)

We recommend prioritizing safe targeting regions that are greater than 2 kb in length.

**Quick start**

For simplicity, we also provide bed files of the above-mentioned safe targeting regions at crispr_safe_targeting_regions/bed
